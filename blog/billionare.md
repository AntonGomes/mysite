Just to clarify...
Beleive it or not, I'm not a millionaire (it's a work in progress), but recently, following up on a friend's reccomendation, I have been listening to the excellent "Indie Hackers" podcast. If your not familiar, the Indie Hackers podcast consist of interviews with successfull (usually tech) startup CEOs. And while listening, I quickly realised that each individual had one major personality trait in common, they were all so.. normal? I mean they weren't Zucc-esc sociopaths, or egotistical Elons, they were just intelligent individuals who were passionate about what they do, which I don't think is too much to ask for us aspiring millionares. So what is it, whats the trick, the secret, what are they not tellin us?! Well here's the thing, they are tellilng us! Every episode the amazing Courtalnd Allen (the show's host) asks the same question: "If you have any advice for someone wanting to start a tech business what would it be?" (or something along those lines), and I am sure I'm not the only one to notice, but there are absolutely some trends in the advice these "tech wiz's" keep dishing out. So no, there isn't one trick that has been stoping you from reaching your full potential as an egotistical tech overlord, but it does seem like there are some quite obvious patterns which play a mojor role in the bussiness plans of many of these unicorns we keep hearing about. And I might be a broke student but a pattern is a pattern, so here I am sharing what I believe is some pretty legit advice.

Don't reinvent the wheel

Use your anger

Look around!
