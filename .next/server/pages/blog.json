In men's fasion a T-shirt is a T-shirt, the only dfferenciating factor (despite minor changes in material or fit) being the repuation of it's brand. \nIn women's fasion a T-shirt can be a T-shirt, or a crop top, or a baby T, or a dress top ect ect. Hence, as a man, in order to differenciate one's style they must focus on the brand of the item.Resulting in gravitation towards \"high-emd\" products.\nThe exeption is designer hand bags and other accessories. However this only proves the rule! Accessories such as handbags, like men's T-shirts, do not have many differencieating factors, and so brands are used to depict the a handbag's quality, price and functionalty. \nSo next time your sat wondering why on Earth this person would spend Â£600 on a jacket that looks like a binbag, try not to judge too harshly.\n","slug":"/blog/moncler.md"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
